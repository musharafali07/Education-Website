Briefly explain the purpose of the video and what the viewer will learn. Mention that HTML and CSS are the fundamental technologies for building websites.

First, create a new folder on your computer to store all the files for your website.

Next, create an HTML file for your homepage. You can do this by creating a new file in the folder you created and naming it "index.html".

Open the "index.html" file in a text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime Text.

To create the structure of your homepage, you will need to use HTML tags. The basic structure of an HTML file includes the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

Inside the <head> tag, you can add a <title> tag to specify the title of your webpage. You can also include other elements, such as meta tags and link tags to link to your CSS stylesheet.

Inside the <body> tag, you can add content to your webpage using various HTML tags, such as <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, and <img> for images.

Once you have added your content to the homepage, you can create additional HTML files for other pages on your website, such as an "about" page or a "contact" page.

To add styling to your website, you can create a CSS stylesheet. This can be done by creating a new file in the same folder and naming it "style.css".

In the "style.css" file, you can use CSS rules to specify how different elements on your webpage should be displayed. For example, you can use the font-size property to specify the size of your headings, or the color property to specify the color of your text.

To link your CSS stylesheet to your HTML files, you can use the <link> tag inside the <head> tag of your HTML files.

That's the basic process for creating an education website using HTML and CSS
